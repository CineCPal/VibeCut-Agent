"""
tests/test_xml_export.py
Unit tests for xml_export.py's frame/timecode math -- specifically that
export_xml()'s timeline-clipitem builders (_track_clipitem_xml /
_track_clipitem_xml_audio) use a single, uniform frame rate (the
SEQUENCE's rate) for every field of a timeline clipitem, regardless of
a given clip's own native frame rate.

This was confirmed the hard way: an earlier version tried expressing a
clipitem's <in>/<out>/<duration>/<rate> at the clip's own native rate
(to match its <file> block) while keeping <start>/<end> at the
sequence's rate. That produced clips that showed up in a real Premiere
Pro import with the diagonal-hash "insufficient media" warning -- turns
out Premiere reads a clipitem's <in>/<out> at the SEQUENCE's rate
regardless of what the clipitem's own <rate> (or its file's native
rate) declares, so mixing rates within one clipitem made the requested
in/out range resolve to a longer real-world duration than the source
file actually has. These tests pin the reverted, Premiere-verified
behavior so it doesn't drift back.

export_xml() (and _file_url underneath it) never opens or requires the
source media file to exist on disk -- it only does path string
manipulation and frame-count arithmetic -- so these tests build
ClipResult objects by hand (paths that don't exist are fine) and write
into pytest's `tmp_path` fixture. No real video files, ffmpeg, or GPU/
CLIP model needed.
