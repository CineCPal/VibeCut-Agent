"""
tests/test_analyzer_scoring.py
Unit tests for analyzer.py's composite-scoring and segment-selection
logic (_normalize, _composite, _score_clip/rescore_clip).

Deliberately does NOT touch analyze_clip() itself, or anything that
opens/decodes a real video file (_open_video_capture, _capture_thumbnail,
open_segment_capture, _probe_audio_format, _probe_fps_fallback) -- those
need real media fixtures and belong in a separate integration-style
suite. Everything here operates on FrameSample/ClipResult objects built
by hand, so it runs fast and needs nothing on disk.
