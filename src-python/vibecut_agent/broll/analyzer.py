"""
analyzer.py
Core video analysis engine for the B-Roll Analyzer app.

For each video clip, samples frames at a fixed interval and scores them on:
  - Sharpness (focus quality, via variance of Laplacian)
  - Exposure (correct brightness, low clipping)
  - Stability / motion quality (penalizes shaky/jittery footage, doesn't
    penalize smooth pans or steady motion)
  - Optionally ("content-aware scoring"), "high energy / exciting shot"
    content and -- given an editor's brief -- how well each frame matches
    it, via a local (no cloud, no Anthropic API) SigLIP 2 vision model --
    see vision_energy.py. Disabled by default; enable with
    enable_energy=True (+ relevance_targets for a brief).

It then finds the best contiguous segment(s) within the clip (a sliding
window) and reports an overall clip score plus recommended in/out points.

    """Recompute overall_score, best segment(s), and best_window_* from
    a ClipResult's already-collected per-frame samples, without
    re-decoding or re-sampling the source video.

    Used by result_cache.py: window length, segments-per-clip, and
    energy weight only affect how per-frame samples are *combined*
    into a score, not the samples themselves -- so a cached clip can be
    re-scored for new settings almost instantly instead of re-running
    the (comparatively expensive) frame decode + optical flow + vision-model
    scoring pass.

    `result.energy_enabled` and `enable_energy` answer two different
    questions and must both be true for energy to affect the score:
      - result.energy_enabled: do the cached *samples* actually contain
        real per-frame vision-model energy values (data availability -- set
        once, when the samples were collected, and left untouched
        here so a re-save of the cache doesn't lose that information).
      - enable_energy: does the *current* run want energy factored in
        at all (e.g. the "Detect high-energy shots" checkbox).
    A clip cached with energy data must stop influencing the score the
    moment the checkbox is unchecked -- without this, energy weighting
    would silently keep applying to any clip served from cache,
    regardless of the current setting, since the cached sample data
    doesn't know the checkbox was ever toggled.

    Brief relevance follows the same rule: it's applied only when the
    current run has content-aware scoring on (`enable_energy`), passes
    `relevance_targets` (vision_energy.brief_targets) and the clip has
    embeddings aligned with its samples. Otherwise every sample's
    relevance is 0 and relevance_weight is ignored.

    Deliberately does NOT touch result.thumbnail_jpeg. Settings changes
    here can move the best segment for every cached clip in a folder at
    once, and refreshing every clip's thumbnail on every rescore would
    reseek every source file just to redraw icons nobody may ever look
    at. See analyzer.refresh_thumbnail / thumbnail_is_stale -- callers
    (the UI) refresh a clip's thumbnail on demand instead, e.g. only
    when that clip is actually selected for preview."""
