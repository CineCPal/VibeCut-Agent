"""
xml_export.py
Builds a Final Cut Pro XML (xmeml v5) file from analyzed clips.

This format is natively importable by Adobe Premiere Pro (File > Import...
or drag the .xml into a project). The output contains:
  - A bin ("B-Roll Analysis") with every analyzed clip as a master clip
    (encoded as <clip> elements, which is what Premiere expects for
    Project-panel/bin items as opposed to timeline items), named with
    its quality score for easy browsing.
  - A sequence ("Best B-Roll Selects") that places the best-scoring
    segment of each selected clip back-to-back on the timeline, in rank
    order, so an editor can drop it straight into a project as a
    ready-made selects reel. Each video segment is paired with a
    matching audio item per source channel at the same in/out points --
    a mono clip gets one linked audio item, a stereo clip gets two
    (L/R, each pinned to its source channel via <sourcetrack>), a 5.1
    clip gets six, and so on, each on its own sequence track. This is
    deliberate even for stereo: a single clipitem with
    <channelcount>2</channelcount> silently imports as mono in Premiere,
    so every channel is always split into its own linked item instead.
    The sequence's audio format explicitly declares its output channel
    width (sized to the widest source channel count in the batch)
    rather than leaving it unstated. Original audio stays attached, in
    sync, and in its native format rather than being stripped out. Each
    clip's named channel preset (Mono/Stereo/5.1/etc.) is also carried
    through into its bin comments for easy reference.
